            My name is Aaron Protheroe. I am currently training to be a sotware engineer at Hyperiondev.
            </p>

            <p id="biog">
            Ever since I was young, I've loved solving problems.

            <p id="biog">      
            At the start of the lockdown in 2020 I wanted to put the extra time towards learning
            a new skill. So I taught myself the basic of python from websites, youtube etc.
            I found it all very interesting and seemed to have a bit of a knack for it. So I decided
            to enroll in Hyperiondevs software engineering bootcamp.
            </p>
        
            <p id="biog">
            Throughout this time I learned many valuable skills such as python, java, version control
            systems such as git, how to interact with and build SQL databases as well as some simple
            HTML and CSS.
            </p>
        
            <p id="biog">
            As far as hobbies go. I am an avid surfer, I really enjoy hiking in the beautifulmountains
            around Cape Town and also enjoy playing guitar.
